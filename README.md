## Features

- Disassemble and decompile EE-specific instruction sets (MMI, VU0 macro mode, etc).
- Recover data types, functions and global variables from ELF files with `.mdebug` sections with the included STABS Analyzer.
- Import PCSX2 save states.
- Fix references to global variables with the MIPS-R5900 Constant Reference Analyzer.
- Support for Ghidra 10.3.
